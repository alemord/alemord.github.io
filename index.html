        <h3>Something about my hometown:</h3>
    </div>
    <div id= "div5">
    <h3>Florence was founded as a Roman military colony about the 1st century bce, and during its long history it has been a republic, a seat of the duchy of Tuscany, and a capital (1865–70) of Italy. </h3>
    </div>
    <div id="div3">
    <h3>During the 14th–16th century Florence achieved preeminence in commerce and finance, learning, and especially the arts.</h3>
    </div>
<p id="day3">For many, Florence is synonymous with the Renaissance. Indeed, the city boasts a bevy of artistic and architectural wonders from that time period.</p>
<p id="day3a">However, Florence’s history doesn’t begin and end with the likes of Michelangelo, Machiavelli, or the Medici</p>
